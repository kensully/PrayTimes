# PrayTimes
It's based on `javascript` prayer times calculater here [prayertimes.org](http://praytimes.org/code/).
It calculates and shows Islamic prayer times according to latitude and longitude of the entered location. Default location is Istanbul. If you have an internet connection it fetches your location automagically, if not, I also added a database for Turkey which contains latitude and longitude of locations over 1000 population. You can enter your location by clicking + sign.
